# Welcome to my toolbox

 This is a spot to dump little utilities i write that I might want to share.  couple of things
- Create Skyspark Service .ps1 - INCOMPLETE, was trying to write a cool powershell script to make skyspark into a service using nothing microsoft's own stuff. Didnt work in a time effective way so I gave up and had to move on
- NiagaraModuleManagement - this is some cool stuff to help you comapre modules from one version to another using WSL, and use ROBOCOPY in powershell to just copy up modules that dont come with your new default install. Enjoy!
- SonarV2.ps1 - this is a script to ping stuff on subnets, was useful for me for a moment in time when all i had for a list of things that might be out there was a CSV - this consumes a CSV, pings everything on the CSV, then dumps a CSV back out of things it found.
